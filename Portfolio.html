<center><h2>Amatuer hour: Ramyller Alves</h2></center>
Amateur athletes are the foundation of our sport. As one travels through the amateur ranks, they are able to hone their skills, and showcase their talent. An amateur can gain national recognition or they can fall from the spotlight, in a single race.

At the VurbMoto Silver Dollar Classic last month, a young gun named Ramyller Alves #222 grabbed the attention of the motocross community with an insane performance in the 250b class. After a mediocre start, he battled his way through the pack and won the race with ease. Perhaps more impressive than that, were the slick scrubs the number 222 was throwing throughout the race. Scrubbing is when a rider turns the bike on t he face of a jump while leaning it over, it allows the bike to stay lower while keeping speed as you go over the jump, allowing you to get the power back to the ground more quickly. This technique is used very often by Pros and the nations top amateurs, but never have we seen scrubs like this kids before. Below you can see of video of two jaw dropping scrubs, as well as an on-board helmet cam of his race:

<center><h2> Motocross: The New face of Progress</h2></center>

<p>It was a hot July day in Millville,Minnesota. Chad Reed, the overall points leader for the Lucas Oil Motocross Championship, was working hard to increase his lead over the pack. It was the 1st lap of Heat 2 in the 450cc class, and Reed, leading, was riding smoothly until he hit a bump on the face of a jump that sent his bike sideways. Flying 50 feet through in air, he became separated from his bike and hit the ground. As soon as he hit, he was able to quickly get his shit together; he climbed back on his mangled bike and tore back onto the track. He ended up finishing in 14th place in that race--he was 34th out of 35th immediately following his crash. No one in their right mind would get back on that bike after such a horrendous crash, but, then again, if you want to win you can't be sane. This is one among many reasons that Chad Reed is considered one of the best motocross racers of all time. Not only is he good, damn good, but he is spirited with a drive to win like none other. A racer's enthusiasm such as Reed's also plays into why the sport itself is and has remained so exhilarating.

<p>Motocross began in the 1920's with races across rough terrain on road motorcycles. In 1924, the 1st ever documented scramble--a motorcycle race through wooded or rugged natural terrain--took place. Motocross came to the United States in the 1960's with Edison Dye. Born in Iowa in 1918, Dye had a fascination with anything that went fast right from the start. This fueled his passion for motorcycles, which led to his discovery of motocross during a tour in Europe. He fell in love with the sport and decided to bring it back to the states featuring his favorite motocross bikes, Husqvarna's.

<p>Initially Dye was simply trying to sell Husqvarna dirt bikes to Americans, but he ended up making American motocross take off. Husqvarna dirt bikes were different than other brands sold in America because they used a 2-stroke engine, rather than a 4 stroke. Aside from that, riders that demonstrated them initially used a completely different and acrobatic riding style. This flabbergasted American riders, and took the industry by storm.

<p>Between 1965 and 1975 the American motocross industry grew a hundredfold. This was due to many factors; one of which was the Vietnam War. Following the war, more durable, high-quality parts became more readily available and cheaper. Another factor was the negative image associated with motorcycles and the people who rode them at the time. Because motocross was viewed as an athletic sport, parents were more willing to consider purchasing a motocross bike rather than a road bike for their adventurous teens. A motocross bike has a much stiffer suspension than a road bike, it also generally has a smaller engine, that packs a lot more power. They are significantly louder, and idle at lower RPMs. They are equipped with “Knobbies” which are knobbed off-road tires designed for maximum traction. People use off-road bikes and motocross specific bikes to race, so a dirt bike is a general term. But the average dirt bike will cost around $4 thousand to $8 thousand new, but you can find a used one for fifteen hundred dollars. The bikes that the best riders use top of the line bikes, with countless modifications--can cost in upwards of $100 thousand dollars.

<p>Motocross didn't start booming in popularity until the 1970's, when companies such as Honda started to mass produce motorcycles specifically designed for off-road use. In 1969, Gary Bailey, who was born in a L.A. suburb, and grew up around motorcycles, became the first American to defeat the Europeans in motocross. He remembered in the early days, before the motorcycles were so specialized, he and his brother riding to races on their bikes, racing them, and then riding them back home. These “Dirt Bikes” have evolved from small, clumsy pieces of crap, into highly efficient beasts that have ridiculous power.

<p>In 1974, Charles Dillen, a Belgian FIM official, was watching a race in Ohio and talking to some Americans. During their conversation it was said that Europeans will always command the sport, at which point he raised his arms and proclaimed "No, it is only logical. There are hundreds of young riders here, and you have hundreds of tracks just like this across a very large nation. If tiny Belgium can produce champions from such a small population, think of what America will do. Your domination of the sport is inevitable." By 1981, his prediction had come true; America won their first Trophee des Nations, an international event in which countries send their top riders to compete against eachother. Remarkably, Americans Won this title ever year from 1981-1993.

<p>During this reign of supremacy, Supercross--an indoor version of motocrosss--also became increasingly popular. Though they seem similar, motocross and supercross, are very different. Motocross takes place outdoors, on open tracks, with natural terrain and elements playing key roles. Supercross is held in stadiums, on man-made tracks, where climate and track conditions are controlled. Generally motocross is a much more fast paced and throttle open race, whereas in supercross is very technical, and jumps have to be hit perfectly. In addition, motocross is viewed as much more physically demanding because of the elements; rain and heat play a very large factor, and because tracks are on open land, they are much larger, and therefore the races are longer.

<p>The first supercross race in America was held in the Los Angeles Coliseum in 1972. This marked the birth of a multi-billion dollar industry in America. The supercross stardom that we are used to, began with a man named Jeremy McGrath. What the Yankees are to baseball, the Patriots are to football, and the Williams Sisters are to tennis, McGrath was to supercross, performing consistently throughout his entire career, he built himself a dynasty. McGrath was the draw; the reason people started watching the sport, and the reason stadiums sold out. He brought glitz and stardom, to a down and dirty sport. His supercross career was launched in 1990 with his first overall win, followed by an overall 2nd place finish on the points board by the end of the season. 1990 marked the beginning of an era; an era of dominance, grace, and speed. McGrath took the title in the 125cc supercross championship in 1991 and 1992 and the 250cc supercross championship seven times between 1993-2000, missing the title only in 1997. McGrath opened the gate to the sport, and eventually the torch was passed on to Ricky Carmichael.

<p>Ricky Carmichael is as close to f perfection as you can get on a motorcycle. Today each sport has a Greatest of All Time or G.O.A.T. In most people's minds, Ricky Carmichael is the G.O.A.T. of motocross and supercross alike. Standing at a massive 5' 6”, he is how you would picture a typical star athlete. But, this is a sport where size doesn't matter. So what does matter in motocross? What do you need to be the best? You need determination, you need to think outside of the box, and you need balls (well, not literally due to the copious amount of great women riders). You can't be afraid to tangle handlebars going around a turn, but if you are a great, you won't have to: the rest of the pack will be five seconds behind you after the first lap. Carmichael does this; if he had a rear view mirror, he wouldn't even be able to see his opponents in it! Next to take the torch and the trophies from Carmichael was James “Bubba” Stewart. Needless to say Carmichael has retired from competitive motocross/supercross, and has started to host events for amateurs.

<p>Bubba is one of a limited number of African-American riders in the world of motocross, and remains a top competitor today. He is by far, the ballsiest the sport has ever seen. Some view him as a dirty rider, and others just wonder whether he gives a shit about his well-being. He makes a lot of mistakes, but also makes a lot of jaws drop.

<p>Although Chad Reed came on the scene before Bubba Stewart, Stewart has commanded more attention because of his aggressive riding practices. Reed has been around a long time, and has been a strong competitor for Stewart and a superstar ever since he began competing. He has won multiple titles and is consistently great. In my eyes, Reed is the face of American motocross at the moment.

<p>Born in 1982, in Kurri Kurri, Australia, Reed trained throughout his early life and began his professional career in Australia in 1998, where he began in the 250cc class, skipping the 125cc class which is usually used as a "stepping stone."  After winning the Australian 250cc Supercross championship in 1999 and 2000, he traveled Europe to race in the FIM 250cc Motocross championships, where he placed second.

<p>In 2002, he started his path to stardom by traveling to the United States. Immediately upon his arrival, he was signed by Yamaha of Troy to ride in the 125cc class. In the 125cc class he had one victory in his career, and finished off the year third, behind Stewart. The following season (2003), he jumped back up to the 250cc class and rode for factory Yamaha--riding for a factory team is the highest ranking you can go; there are five factory teams: Yamaha, Suzuki, Kawasaki, Honda, and KTM--and finished in third behind Kevin Windham and Carmichael. In 2004 Reed finally won the 250cc supercross championship, beating out Windham, but came in second behind Carmichael in motocross. The following year, Stewart entered the 250cc class, but he came in third, with Reed second, and Carmichael first…again. In 2006, Reed and Carmichael were tied in points going into the final race for the 250cc supercross championship, but due to a shoulder separation he wasn't able to ride as hard as normal, so Carmichael took the championship by a mere 2 points. Reed also came in second in motocross. 2007 was a revolutionary Year for Reed as he left Factory Yamaha and formed his own Private team. That year he came in second behind Stewart. 2008 marked the year of his second win of the AMA Supercross Championship. He absolutely dominated this competition, beating the next closest competitor by 13 points. He joined team Rockstar Makita Suzuki for the '09 season where he just barely lost to Stewart.

<p>In 2010, he joined team Monster Kawasaki with teammate Ryan Villopoto; this turned out to be the worst year in his professional career. He had to drop out early in the season; in the first round he collided in both races, once with Stewart where he broke his hand. Though a bad year in his professional life, he became a new father, so it may have been for the best that he dropped out early that year.

<p>In contrast to the  previous year, 2011 marked one of the best years of his career. Due to his poor performance the year before, he had trouble making negotiations with any teams, choosing instead to form his own, called "Two Two Motorsports." He got his hands on a CRF450R and Shift Riding gear and went into the competition ready for battle. The 2011 season was one of the best in AMA history due to a tight, 5 way battle between Reed, Stewart, Villopoto, Dungey, and Trey Canard. Reed ended up coming in second in the series but won an award for his outstanding performance with his new team. The following season, in 2012 he was battling hard with Villopoto but ended up tearing his ACL in a crash, effectively ending his season.

<p>While Reed and Stewart remain fierce competitors, Ryan Dungey and Ryan Villopoto are the superstars of the moment. This is not because they are more talented, although they have been beating Stewart and Reed recently, but because they are the next era of greatness. In this sport, careers are short, and time is limited. A long and lustrous career may be 10 years if you are lucky.

<p>Now those are just some of his biggest career milestones, he also has a few X-Games medals and plethora of other wins in different types of competitions. Oh, and not to mention he is one of a select few riders that can perform a backflip.

<p>The sport of motocross began with a few men who wanted to go fast, and has grown into one of the largest motor sports in the world. Chad Reed has helped revolutionize motocross and is one of the fastest men to ever mount a bike. Many think he doesn't get as much credit as he deserves. There were times when people told him that he wasn't fast enough, and he said “watch me,” and proved them wrong. When other people told him no, Chad Reed looked them right back in the eyes and said yes. He created his own team and is still one of the fiercest competitors in the sport. People say that his career is coming to an end; I say there is still a lot of tread left on those tires. Even if he is, the sport is in great hands, as the torch is passed, and more history is ready to be made.
